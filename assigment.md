Assessment: Task Management System
The goal to assess your solution design, architecture and trade-offs decisions in addition to the coding skills on both
frontend & backend.
Tech stack:
• Use any backend framework and database of your choice.
• Use any frontend framework with Typescript.
• Feel free to use any third party libraries.
Problem Statement:
We'd like you to build a simple task management system where users can create, view, update and delete tasks. A task
consists of a title, description, priority and due date. Users should be able to mark a task as completed or delete it if
needed. The users should be able to filter the tasks by priority and/or due date.
Additional Requirements:
• Only some users, say validators/admins can delete tasks.
• Not possible to create tasks on public holidays.
• Users should be able to undo changes.
Frontend Requirements:
• Friendly user experience.
• Responsive design.
Problem Solving:
Describe how can you solve following problems/requirements (No need to implement in code)
• Add/integrate your task management to any calendar provider.
• Security considerations for production usage.
• Allow users to share tasks with other people.
Things to consider:
• Explanation of the assumptions made
• Structure of the Code
• Testing strategies
• Design and thought process
• Adhering to best practices
• Devops friendly Automation
• Documentation & instructions
